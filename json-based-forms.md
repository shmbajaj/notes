# Json Based Forms

Declaratively build and customize web forms using json.

<pre>
Make request to the api, get the json-response. 
Parse and Validate the response.
Tranform the response into headless-form-library format.
Display the form.
</pre>

The json based forms helps to abstract the process of building, re-building and re-building forms declaratively.

```
To stretch your imagination a bit, what if you could generate all of your code based on these JSON forms? The simplicity of abstracting things to JSON leaves you with endless possibilities.
